## Lyrics
Separated through the mounds
Searching for the answer they are our trials
We came so far through our weakness we felt the love
Even the stars between us won’t marry us

One day we can be together
And this moment could have last forever
I say to you and I have found a piece of heaven
So one day we can be together

One day
(ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh)
One day

We found love in separate ways 
Heartbreak is a wonderful price to pay
We came so far 
Through our weakness we felt the love
Even the stars between us won’t marry us

One day we can be together
And this moment could have last forever
I say to you and I have found a piece of heaven
So one day we can be together

One day
One day we can be together
And this moment could have last forever
